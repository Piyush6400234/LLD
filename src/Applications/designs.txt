4 important things should be present in cold messages which i feel are very important:

1. Some personal touch like Hi Shrayansh, not just Hi Sir/Mam.

2. Why i should refer you, in this generally small 3-4 lines, if we can provide the sense that yes i have gone through the job description and i am best for it, try to add Job level like SDE1, Sde2 etc, skills , yr of experience.

3. Job link

4. Resume pdf and drive link.

Also follow ups plays an important role in increasing the probability of getting a referral.
