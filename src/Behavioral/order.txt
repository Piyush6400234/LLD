Here’s an order of difficulty for common behavioral design patterns in Low-Level Design (LLD), ranging from the easiest
to the most challenging. The difficulty level is based on factors like implementation complexity, learning curve, and
the degree of abstraction or interaction between objects.

========================================== :Strategy Pattern (Easiest): ========================================

1). Purpose: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
2). Difficulty: Easy
3). Why: It involves creating multiple interchangeable algorithms (strategies) and is mostly about interface-based polymorphism.
4). Example: Different sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort) that can be swapped depending on the context.
Key Concepts: Interface, polymorphism.


=========================================== :Template Method Pattern: ========================================

1). Purpose: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
2). Difficulty: Easy to Moderate
3). Why: Requires defining a superclass with a template method and abstract methods for steps that need subclass-specific implementations.
4). Example: Cooking recipe where certain steps are fixed, but others (like specific ingredients) can vary.
Key Concepts: Abstract classes, inheritance, method overriding.

=========================================== :Observer Pattern: ===============================================

1). Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
2). Difficulty: Moderate
3). Why: Requires understanding of subject-observer relationships, registration, and event-driven systems.
4). Example: UI frameworks where UI elements (observers) are updated based on changes to data models (subjects).
Key Concepts: Event handling, publisher-subscriber, loose coupling.

============================================ :Chain of Responsibility Pattern: ===============================

1). Purpose: Allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will handle it. Multiple objects can handle the request, but the responsibility is passed along a chain.
2). Difficulty: Moderate
3). Why: Involves creating chains of objects that handle requests in sequence, with potential recursion or delegation.
4). Example: Customer support escalation (first handled by a junior, then escalated to senior levels).
Key Concepts: Request handling, delegation, loose coupling.

=========================================== :Command Pattern:  ===============================================

1). Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
2). Difficulty: Moderate to Challenging
3). Why: Requires the creation of commands, command invokers, and receivers. It adds flexibility to undo/redo operations.
4). Example: Remote control where each button is mapped to different command objects (like turn on/off, change volume).
Key Concepts: Encapsulation of operations, undo/redo.

=========================================== :Iterator Pattern: ===============================================

1). Purpose: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
2). Difficulty: Moderate to Challenging
3). Why: Involves implementing both internal and external iteration. Managing iteration state while keeping the collection details abstract can be tricky.
4). Example: Iterating over a collection like a list or a tree without knowing its internal structure.
Key Concepts: Traversal, encapsulation, state management.

=========================================== :State Pattern: ==================================================

1). Purpose: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
2). Difficulty: Challenging
3). Why: It involves creating distinct state classes and switching behaviors dynamically at runtime, which increases design complexity.
4). Example: A traffic light that changes behavior based on its state (red, green, yellow).
Key Concepts: State machines, dynamic behavior changes.

=========================================== :Memento Pattern: ===============================================

1). Purpose: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later without violating encapsulation.
2). Difficulty: Challenging
3). Why: It requires saving and restoring the internal state in a controlled manner, ensuring encapsulation and handling potential memory issues.
4). Example: Undo functionality in text editors where you can save and revert back to previous states.
Key Concepts: State capture and restoration, encapsulation.

=========================================== :Mediator Pattern: ==============================================

1). Purpose: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other directly.
2). Difficulty: Challenging
3). Why: Involves managing complex interactions among objects by centralizing communication in a mediator, making the system design more intricate.
4). Example: Chat rooms where users communicate indirectly through the chat room (mediator).
Key Concepts: Decoupling, centralized communication.

=========================================== :Interpreter Pattern (Toughest): ===============================

1). Purpose: Defines a grammar for a language and uses an interpreter to interpret sentences in that language.
2). Difficulty: Toughest
3). Why: It requires understanding formal grammars, building abstract syntax trees, and implementing parsing logic, which is complex and domain-specific.
4). Example: SQL query interpreter or mathematical expression parser.
Key Concepts: Parsing, grammar interpretation, abstract syntax trees.
