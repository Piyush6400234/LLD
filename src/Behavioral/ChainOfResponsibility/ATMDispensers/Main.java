In this use case:

--->The ATM needs to dispense a specific amount of money.
--->The money will be dispensed in various denominations, such as 100s, 50s, and 20s bills.
--->The ATM should try to dispense the largest denomination first, and if thatâ€™s not possible (due to the remaining
    balance), it moves to the next denomination, and so on.
